Welcome to the MIT 805 Assignment Page

From here, we will coordinate our efforts on Assignment 2 and assignment 3.

The dataset that we are going to be operating on is the Chicago Crime Dataset.

It is accessible here: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

If a more in-depth analysis should be required, the report constructed for Assignment 1 can be provided as an introduction into the dataset.
