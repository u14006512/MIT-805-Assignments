This file contains some suggestions for content for assignment 3 (visualisations).

Have a look in this directory for some of the visualisation I've looked at (simple stuff in Python, uses the output from MapReduce):
    https://github.com/u14006512/MIT-805-Assignments/tree/master/Assignment%202/Code/Francois
    
Remember that there is a lot of probability/likelihood data in 
  https://github.com/u14006512/MIT-805-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%202/Code/Francois/Results/Arrests%20Likelihood%20Table.txt
as pertains to arrests (this is what the Naive Bayes was trained on). 
  
=== MUST_HAVES
I think its essential that we show the 'simpler' stuff as well, like a basic bar chart with crime count per type. 
[ ] Crimes per year, barchart using matplotlib in Python, https://github.com/u14006512/MIT-805-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%202/Code/Francois/1.%20Crimes%20per%20Year.viz.py
[ ] Crimes per type, barchart using matplotlib in Python, https://github.com/u14006512/MIT-805-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%202/Code/Francois/4.%20Crimes%20per%20Type.viz.py
[ ] Arrests per year (perhaps rather as a percentage), barchart using matplotlib in Python, https://github.com/u14006512/MIT-805-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%202/Code/Francois/7.%20Arrests%20per%20Year.viz.py
[ ] Visualisations for the SOM as described in assignment 2.

=== NICE_TO_HAVES
It would be nice to have a longitudinal element, where we show things over or across time. 
[ ] Heat map with location data overlayed onto a map of the Chicago inner city. Not sure what to show yet, maybe arrest rate as a percentage?

====Comments about Visualisations: Emilio
I just thought I'd separate my own thoughts on the matter to keep everything nice and neat.

I don't think we need to visualise anything using the whole dataset; I've run a lot of the MapReduce extractors and I have that data so it's very easy to plug those results into a visualisation tool like Python's Plot and then get out a nice graph that's still a summary of the dataset as a whole.

Importantly, we need to display a variety of things. 

I think that we have enough to display some of the graphs as described above. 

====SOM Visualisations
1) U-Matrix
2) Labelled Maps 

To produce these, I need a list of geo-location data with labels. Francois, I think you might be able to provide me with that. 
I think I can then produce the maps and visualisations. Importantly, I don't think a huge map will be necessary (or even possible) so that's not a huge issue.

====Apriori Visualisations
I think I can produce some visualisations of the rules. In a tree structure possibly, I might have to play around with them. At worst, we'll show a table with all of the results and that will have to do to demonstrate rules. The reason I think we need to put them there, is because they form a huge part of the learned insight into the dataset.

We need to have them there to talk about and so they need to be included.

====Insight
In the structure I've laid down for the document, basically each visualisation must be succeeded by a discussion of:
1) What is shown
2) Why it's important
3) Does it have any issues

This way, we can tie everything together at the end in a more general results discussion by referencing some of the facts earlier on.
