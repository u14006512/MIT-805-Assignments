This file contains some suggestions for content for assignment 3 (visualisations).

Have a look in this directory for some of the visualisation I've looked at (simple stuff in Python, uses the output from MapReduce):
    https://github.com/u14006512/MIT-805-Assignments/tree/master/Assignment%202/Code/Francois
    
Remember that there is a lot of probability/likelihood data in 
  https://github.com/u14006512/MIT-805-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%202/Code/Francois/Results/Arrests%20Likelihood%20Table.txt
as pertains to arrests (this is what the Naive Bayes was trained on). 
  
=== MUST_HAVES
I think its essential that we show the 'simpler' stuff as well, like a basic bar chart with crime count per type. 
[ ] Crimes per year, barchart using matplotlib in Python, https://github.com/u14006512/MIT-805-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%202/Code/Francois/1.%20Crimes%20per%20Year.viz.py
[ ] Crimes per type, barchart using matplotlib in Python, https://github.com/u14006512/MIT-805-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%202/Code/Francois/4.%20Crimes%20per%20Type.viz.py
[ ] Arrests per year (perhaps rather as a percentage), barchart using matplotlib in Python, https://github.com/u14006512/MIT-805-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%202/Code/Francois/7.%20Arrests%20per%20Year.viz.py
[ ] Visualisations for the SOM as described in assignment 2.

=== NICE_TO_HAVES
It would be nice to have a longitudinal element, where we show things over or across time. 
[ ] Heat map with location data overlayed onto a map of the Chicago inner city. Not sure what to show yet, maybe arrest rate as a percentage?
