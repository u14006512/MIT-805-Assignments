Hi. thanks for all the editing, Francois and Emilio. 
I have two suggestions:
  Can you add a citation and reference for the NOAA database, please? I uploaded a bibtex file for it to this folder. 
    (I could not do the bibliography) Thanks for the citation, Emilio. 
  We should replace the explanation of the crime-temperature graph with the paragraph that I uploaded to this folder (Word). 
    The meaning of the graph is as I explained. The number of crimes peaks at about 20 degrees and it is much lower at the extremes. 
    I will upload a histogram of the daily average temperatures in the weather database, over the period of the Crime database, 
    for information.
