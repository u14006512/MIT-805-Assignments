Comment 1: The ID is used in Naive Bayes, but apart from that it doesn't have meaning, yes.
Comment 3: We can include weather-related things in Assignment 3, but I think the dataset as is has enough to work with. We can break some of the visualisations into monthly if need be - might be a good idea, to display some seasonality.
Comment 5: Ward is actually a factor, Naive Bayes doesn't use distance calculations. I will edit the document to make this clearer.
Comment 7: Disk space is my issue, not processing time, therefore its 'cheaper' using this approach, and it shows that you can do such logic in the map phase. I'll edit to show that disk space is the limiting factor here.
